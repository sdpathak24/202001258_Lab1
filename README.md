### Q.1. 
**Identify FRs and NFRs: The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by the institution. As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only. The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in plain text.**

Functional Requirements: 
1. Allows members to borrow and return books from their workstations or chambers. 
2. Permits a member to prolong the duration of his loan if no other reservations have been made for that specific book. 
3. Permits the librarian to add new records and delete existing records from the database. 
4. Enables online book browsing and searching for non-members. 
5. Only allows legitimate members to borrow and return books.

Non Functional Requirements: 
1. Should be scalable to accommodate the growing size of the institute. 
2. The system should be completely under the librarian's control and with full administrative rights. 
3. Makes sure that private data, such as passwords, is not kept in plain text for security reasons. 
4. Lower the software's security risk. 
5. Only operates inside the institute LAN. 
6. Uses HTML 5 to deliver a web application.

### Q.2. 
**Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem. Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies, where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.**

scope: To satisfy the demands of the 466 million people who have a disabling hearing loss, a mobile application must be developed.

Features: 
1. Uses artificial intelligence to identify important sound occurrences of community interest. 
2. Provides prompt alerts for urgent sounds like baby crying and automobile horns. 
3. User-controlled ongoing logging. 
4. Android-friendly. 
5. Low latency for use in real-time.

Non-functional aspects:
1. User friendliness and accessibility for those with hearing loss, which are non-functional characteristics. 
2. Performance and dependability to guarantee real-time operation of the app. 
3. Security to safeguard user information and privacy. 
4. Scalability, which makes sure the software can accommodate a lot of users. 
5. Support for a variety of Android devices and releases.
